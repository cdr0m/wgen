<h2>Me</h2>
<p>I am just a guy. I like taking photos, motorsports (F1 and WEC mostly), power transmission, and linux. The best way to contact me is by email (ssr7 [@] runbox [.] com, and if you want to, you can use <a href='../media/files/key.txt'>encryption</a>.</p>

<h2>This site</h2>
<p>This website is hosted at Neocities <a target='_blank' href='https://neocities.org/site/seabreeze'>(profile)</a>. It is generated using a simple <a target='_blank' href='https://codeberg.org/ssr7/wgen/src/branch/master/src/wgen.rb'>script</a> that I made. I input some html files and it outputs assembled pages that are linked together. I am only a beginner at programming, so the script may not be very efficient and doesn't have many features, but I had fun creating it.</p>
