<h2>2023</h2>

<h3>June</h3>
<p>This is my first full month of not having Windows installed to my main computer. I was waiting for important emails at the end of May and spent a lot of time inside caring for my budgie. I made backups and installed <a href='https://gentoo.org'>Gentoo Linux</a> onto the spare ssd. I've worked with Gentoo before on my old Thinkpad, and mostly knew what to do. Getting grub, the kernel, and disk encryption to work correctly was the only problem but I found a solution after taking a break for a few days.</p>

<p>I had Debian on my old raspberry pi 3, but it now runs OpenSUSE Leap. I used the old Thinkpad to learn Gentoo several years ago and was able to use most of my notes to get my current setup working. Most of my desktop computing has been Windows based until now. I have tried Ubuntu (way back in version 7.04), Fedora, OpenSUSE, Debian on my older desktops but had driver problems. Early on, it was my laptop's wifi, later, my  nvidia card was too old for the driver, scrolling and moving windows was very sluggish and looked ugly.</p>

<p>Why Gentoo?</p>

<p>I went with this distro because it kind of forces you to learn about Linux. I like computers and learning these things is fun to do, so it's not for everyone. There's good documentation on the <a href='https://wiki.gentoo.org/'>wiki</a> and <a href='https://forums.gentoo.org/'>forums</a>, and on the <a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/'>Arch wiki</a> for anything that's not Gentoo-specific.</p>

<p>The unique feature of Gentoo is the USE flags, which allows customisation of the packages I install. Almost all packages must be compiled from source, and with the USE flags, you get a package that's different from what the other distros give you.</p>

<p>If I ever replace Gentoo on my main rig, I would likely replace it with <a href='https://voidlinux.org/'>Void Linux</a>. <a href='https://nixos.org/'>NixOS</a> looks interesting, and might play around with it in a vm before considering that one.</p>
